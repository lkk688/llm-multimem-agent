# Multimodal Memory LLM Agent

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Multimodal Memory LLM Agent project. This framework provides a modular and extensible architecture for building advanced AI applications with large language models (LLMs), multimodal capabilities, and persistent memory.

## Core Modules

### [Tool Calling and Agent Capabilities](agents.md)

Explore the implementation of LLM agents with tool-calling capabilities, including:

- Function calling and ReAct approaches
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized context injection
- Multi-agent systems and agentic workflows
- Framework implementations across OpenAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and more

### [Multimodal Embeddings](embeddings.md)

Learn about our unified interface for generating embeddings across different modalities:

- Text embeddings evolution from Word2Vec to modern approaches
- Image, audio, and multimodal embedding techniques
- Support for multiple embedding frameworks and models

### [LLM Frameworks and Architectures](llm.md)

Dive into the technical details of LLM implementation:

- Evolution from RNNs to Transformer architectures
- Optimization techniques for inference and deployment
- Integration with various LLM providers and frameworks

### [Memory Systems](memory.md)

Understand how persistent memory enhances LLM capabilities:

- Context window management and conversation history
- Vector-based retrieval for semantic search
- Structured knowledge storage and retrieval
- Long-term memory implementations

## Getting Started

Explore the documentation for each module to understand the architecture, implementation details, and usage examples. The project provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to various use cases and deployment scenarios.
