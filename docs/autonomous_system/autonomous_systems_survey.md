## SAE Autonomy Levels

![SAE Autonomy Levels](https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/gallery/cm/articles/press-releases/2021/12/j3016-levels-of-automation-image.png)

### Level 2 (Partial Automation)

SAE Level 2 represents partial automation where the vehicle can control both steering and acceleration/deceleration simultaneously, but the human driver must remain engaged and monitor the driving environment at all times. Key characteristics include:

- **Driver Responsibility**: Driver must keep hands on wheel and eyes on road at all times
- **Continuous Supervision**: Driver is responsible for monitoring the environment and taking immediate control
- **Combined Functions**: System can handle steering AND acceleration/braking together
- **No Legal Disengagement**: Driver cannot legally divert attention from driving tasks
- **Fallback Responsibility**: Driver is the fallback for all driving situations

**Examples**: Tesla Autopilot/FSD, GM Super Cruise, Ford BlueCruise, Mercedes-Benz Driver Assistance Package

### Level 3 (Conditional Automation)

SAE Level 3 represents conditional automation where the vehicle can perform all driving tasks under specific conditions, but the human driver must be ready to take control when requested <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot" index="1">1</mcreference>. Key characteristics include:

- **Driver Responsibility**: Driver can legally take eyes off the road but must remain alert
- **Operational Domain**: Limited to specific conditions (highways, traffic jams, mapped areas)
- **Speed Limitations**: Typically operates under 40-60 mph
- **Takeover Requirement**: Driver must resume control within seconds when prompted

### Key Differences Between Level 2 and Level 3

The transition from Level 2 to Level 3 represents a **fundamental shift in responsibility** and legal liability:

| Aspect | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Driver Attention** | Must monitor environment continuously | Can divert attention under specific conditions |
| **Legal Responsibility** | Driver responsible for all driving tasks | System responsible during automated mode |
| **Hands-on Requirement** | Hands on wheel required | Hands-free operation allowed |
| **Eyes-on-Road** | Eyes must remain on road | Eyes can be diverted (reading, phone use) |
| **Fallback Responsibility** | Driver is always the fallback | System handles fallback within ODD |
| **Regulatory Approval** | Minimal regulatory oversight | Requires extensive certification and approval |

### Why Most Cars (Including Tesla) Remain at Level 2

Despite advanced capabilities, most manufacturers including Tesla maintain Level 2 classification due to several critical factors:

#### **1. Regulatory and Legal Challenges**
- **Liability Concerns**: Level 3 requires manufacturers to accept legal responsibility for accidents during automated mode
- **Certification Requirements**: Extensive testing and regulatory approval processes involving multiple organizations:
  - **SAE International**: Defines the J3016 standard for automation levels
  - **NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)**: US federal safety standards and approval
  - **FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards)**: Compliance requirements for vehicle safety
  - **State DMVs**: Individual state permits for testing and deployment (California DMV, Nevada DMV, etc.)
  - **ISO 26262**: Functional safety standard for automotive systems
  - **UN-ECE WP.29**: Global technical regulations for automated driving systems
  - **TÃœV and other certification bodies**: Third-party testing and validation
  - **Example**: Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot required 3+ years of development, extensive real-world testing, and approval from German KBA (Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt) and US NHTSA before certification
- **Insurance Implications**: Complex insurance frameworks needed for shared liability models

#### **2. Technical Limitations**
- **Edge Case Handling**: Systems struggle with unpredictable scenarios (construction zones, emergency vehicles, unusual weather)
- **Sensor Reliability**: Current sensor technology has limitations in adverse conditions
- **Geographic Constraints**: Level 3 systems require detailed mapping and infrastructure support

#### **3. Human-Machine Interface Challenges**
- **Takeover Time**: Ensuring drivers can resume control quickly enough when system reaches its limits
- **Attention Management**: Difficulty in keeping drivers alert during automated periods
- **Trust Calibration**: Balancing user confidence without over-reliance on the system

#### **4. Business and Strategic Considerations**
- **Cost vs. Benefit**: Level 3 certification costs may not justify limited operational domains
- **Market Positioning**: Some manufacturers prefer "advanced Level 2" marketing over restricted Level 3
- **Gradual Deployment**: Incremental improvement strategy rather than revolutionary jumps

#### **Tesla's Specific Case**
- **"Full Self-Driving" Branding**: Despite the name, Tesla FSD remains Level 2 requiring constant supervision
- **Beta Testing Approach**: Tesla uses customer fleet for real-world testing rather than controlled certification
- **Regulatory Strategy**: Avoiding formal Level 3 certification while continuously improving capabilities
- **Liability Model**: Maintaining driver responsibility reduces legal exposure

### Level 4 (High Automation)

Level 4 systems can handle all driving tasks within their operational design domain without human intervention <mcreference link="https://www.wired.com/story/chinas-best-self-driving-car-platforms-tested-and-compared-xpeng-nio-li-auto/" index="2">2</mcreference>. Features include:

- **Full Autonomy**: Within specific geographic areas or conditions
- **No Human Intervention**: Required during normal operation
- **Fallback Capability**: System can safely stop if conditions exceed capabilities
- **Commercial Applications**: Robotaxis, delivery vehicles in defined areas

### Level 5 (Full Automation)

Level 5 represents complete autonomy under all conditions that a human driver could handle. **No current system has achieved SAE Level 5** <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot" index="1">1</mcreference>.
